         "Fire is half-human and half monster. Monsters in these lands are beautiful, very bright and colorful and usually have a gift, and they destroy humans. Since half of Fire is human, she has to hide her beautiful red hair at all times and live heavily guarded. Her gift is that she can read and control minds. Because of her gift, she is useful at court. \n However, she is not well-received by the King and his brother. Fire's monster father played a heavy hand in the death of the previous king and they don't trust her. Fire may be half monster, but her humanity overcomes that part of her. She's kind and brave. \n In the beginning of Fire, we meet young Leek, who is quite unstable. He's a Graceling who has come through the mountains to the dells unexpectedly. He's cruel and manipulative and has a gift similar to Fire's; the gift of reading and controlling minds. His ambition will cause dissent with Fire and her world that will lead us to a compelling and twisting conclusion. \n Fire is a great fantasy adventure! The characters are well developed and the world is built in such a fantastic way that it's easy to follow and becomes believable. Magical creatures, great battles, political intrigue, a splash of romance, and supernatural abilities mesh so well together that you have a sure-fire hit! Kristin Cashore has done a remarkable job! Young adults and adults alike will enjoy this wonderful tale.",

         "Katsa is a graceling - blessed with an ability (in her case, ability to kill easily) that marks her as different. Her uncle, the king, uses her as his personal enforcer, sending her out to hurt those who displease him. On one such trip, Katsa encounters a young man, a prince from a neighboring country, and after that, their fates will be entwined as she must learn to use her abilities compassionately and not as her Uncle's thug. But he has a secret grace and she will be drawn into politics of the world on a grand scale. \n This is a stand alone though there are two other books in this same world (one a prequel of sorts and the other a sequel but both with different characters). I did feel the book floats around quite a bit and lacks a good solid structure. As well, it can get tiring hearing Katsa echo the same thoughts over and over. Yes, we get the idea you don't want to marry. No, we don't need all the guys falling all over you even though you're supposedly deadly. And yes, we have a hero who is once again just a bit too good to be true.",

         "This is a fun, light-hearted read. Tammy Jo is having a bad week, a really bad week and despite her lack of magical abilities finds herself mixed up in more hocus-pocus than she can handle. And some of it is just plain funny. The humour is what makes the book worth reading. Tammy Jo has a sharp wit and her sarcasm is a joy to partake in. \n The book does feel a little chaotic at times, with Tammy Jo trying to accomplish multiple tasks at the same time, with no real understanding of what is going on around her. Plus, the world-building is a little on the slim side. But, all-in-all, it's a fun little ride. And while the whole werewolf mystery is cleared up, this is still very much a first book in a series. There are a number of threads left loose and a lot of unanswered or unaddressed questions. This left me feeling dissatisfied right at the end. \n I'm also at a bit of a loss about the Bryn/Zach situation. I like both men, despite their serious control issues (Zach especially). It's not quite a love triangle, but is too close to be comfortable. There's little chance of either one escaping unscathed and I find myself cringing at the prospects.",

         "Cassel, was a character that I was looking forward to and grew on me as the book grew to and end. He starts out as a criminal, and a thrifty conman. He was raised to believe in the con, and almost know what who had the upper hand. However, in the beginning you'll realize he's in college and away from his family. Which apparently is good for Cassel, his mother is out for whatever is best for her and her family and his brothers are trying to protect Cassel, even if they aren't going about it the best way. \n At first on the surface I thought the book was going to be about conmen and the thrifty lives they lead. However, I was wrong. The book is partially dealt with than conman lifestyles and than there is the Curse Workers lifestyle. Cruse Workers are different depending on what \"gift\" you have been given. In Cassel's mother's case it's emotion. She makes anyone feel how she needs to, to get the job done. There are those who can work memories and than those who can transform objects. Those who can transform are rare and the most sought after, however when one of the characters posses that ability the whole game changes. \n Cassell is different, he mourns the fact that he's not a curse worker at all, and in a family where everyone is a worker he's left alone. It also doesn't change the haunting nightmare he has every night, the dream of him killing his best friend and possibly first girlfriend. Furthermore I found that the second character I fell in love with was a White Cat that follows Cassell around and helps him along his journey. As Cassell, tries to figure out who he is supposed to find, and what's going on in his life, the White Cat remains by his side. \n I wanted more out of the world, and what it had to offer. I enjoyed the college school scenery and it made the school seem large and welcoming. However out in the world the only world and the only house that seemed worthwhile was the house that Cassel grew up in. The cluttered mess, and the worn down house gave a great backstory to Cassel that a few paragraphs could have explained. Yet how he got around was dumbed down to just driving his car from point A to point B. We see over and over Holly Black can create great worlds, so why doesn't she going from points to points. \n This book won't let you down, in fact it's a great read and a great relaxation piece. I was hooked immediately and if you are remotely interested, or sounds like something you might find interesting. I would almost garauntee that you'll enjoy this book. If you aren't hooked by the first chapter or two, I dunno what I will do, but I will find someone to make it up to you.",

         "This is kind of one of those books that I saw getting popular back with it first came out; many good reviews were popping up in the book community, and yet I continued to overlook it. I didn't even both to read the summary very closely. I was that certain I would dislike it based on the cover and title alone. In my defense, the title is a little misleading. It's different and makes the reader think that the book will be a light, quick vampire story. It was completely by chance that I saw it at a little used bookstore and decided to examine it more closely. To my great surprise, it actually sounded kind of interesting so I sat down and read the first few chapters. I continued to like it, so I bought it and stayed up half the night to finish. \n There was something seriously addicting about this novel; I never wanted to put it down, always very eager to see how it would end. So I guess I could say that my favorite thing about Jessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark Side would be the pacing. It's not on the short side, nor is it particularly long; rather, it tells exactly what it needs to and ends at a satisfying point. Though I did like how it ended, I'm still very excited to pick up the sequel and see what the author has in store for these people. \n Honestly, I loved Jessica's character. She was just a normal teenage girl in the start of the book, and of course she evolves by the end - what with finding out she's a vampire princess and all - but at the same time, she remains much the same in many ways. She reminded me a little of Meghan from the Iron Fey series; she, too, found out she was a princess (a faerie one, but still). Both of them grow up on a farm, as well. Jessica did have moments here and there where she acted kind of stupidly - though she stands up to her love interest a bit, she doesn't do it often enough. \n Lucius (I just recently learned how to pronounce his name, by the way) immediately had my attention from the first time he showed up. Of course, the reader is already aware of what he his and his purposes, but he changes throughout the book almost as much as Jessica does. He bounces back and forth between one extreme to the other, and I kind of felt like he should have a big hug. The chemistry with Jessica (a.k.a. Anastasia) definitely wasn't lacking; there are some steamy moments here, and they were well written and much appreciated. And the letters he writes to his uncle are hilarious. Fantaskey's version of a vampire was interesting. I like the way she built her world with the royalty aspect, but at the same time, I'm confused about how the undead can have children (but then, I'm still confused about that aspect of Twilight, so.). \n I wasn't extremely fond of the side characters - I've heard that Mindy starts narrating some of the time in Jessica Rules the Dark Side, and I have to admit that I was none too thrilled with that. She was an okay character, but I'm not so sure I want to see the story through her eyes. I did, however, enjoy the relationship Jessica had with her parents, and the conflicts brought about by Faith and Jake. I was pretty surprised by the novel took towards the end - I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say I was surprised that who I thought would be the main villain of the book turned out not to be. Overall, I'm just going to go with the classic saying - don't judge a book by its cover (or its title, for that matter), because I'm really glad I picked this up.",

It is the sixteenth century, the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when her shiftless husband disappears to the New World, Ines uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure. After her treacherous journey takes her to Peru, she learns that her husband has died in battle. Soon she begins a fiery love affair with a man who will change the course of her life: Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro.\nValdivia's dream is to succeed where other Spaniards have failed: to become the conquerer of Chile. The natives of Chile are fearsome warriors, and the land is rumored to be barren of gold, but this suits Valdivia, who seeks only honor and glory. Together the lovers Ines Suarez and Pedro de Valdivia will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage a bloody, ruthless war against the indigenous Chileans--the fierce local Indians led by the chief Michimalonko, and the even fiercer Mapuche from the south. The horrific struggle will change them forever, pulling each of them toward their separate destinies.\nInes of My Soulis a work of breathtaking scope: meticulously researched, it engagingly dramatizes the known events of Ines Suarez's life, crafting them into a novel full of the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.",

It is a captivating story about Ines Suarez, a strong and daring woman whose bravery and passion helped conquer love and with it, a beautiful land. Along with Ines, Allende introduces many characters that help mold this story. This story gives us a better understanding of the bravery the conquistadores had and helps us feel compassion for Native Indians, and the suffering they went through in trying to defend their land. Allende does a wonderful job in making each character rich and full of depth. Her descriptions are thorough and poetic. This book will play in your mind days after having read it.",

         "While I did very much enjoy the historical aspect, this book just didn't do it for me. I found it dry and slow (until near the end where the pace picked up), and it took me a long time to get through. I think I'm drawn more to her stories with a surreal and slightly magical lilt, like The House of the Spirits which I just loved. That being said, I'm glad this book exists as a piece of historical fiction.",

         "Born into a poor family in Spain, Ines, a seamstress, finds herself condemned to a life of hard work without reward or hope for the future. It is the sixteenth century, the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when her shiftless husband disappears to the New World, Ines uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure. After her treacherous journey takes her to Peru, she learns that her husband has died in battle. Soon she begins a fiery love affair with a man who will change the course of her life: Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro.\nValdivia's dream is to succeed where other Spaniards have failed: to become the conquerer of Chile. The natives of Chile are fearsome warriors, and the land is rumored to be barren of gold, but this suits Valdivia, who seeks only honor and glory. Together the lovers Ines Suarez and Pedro de Valdivia will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage a bloody, ruthless war against the indigenous Chileans--the fierce local Indians led by the chief Michimalonko, and the even fiercer Mapuche from the south. The horrific struggle will change them forever, pulling each of them toward their separate destinies.\nInes of My Soulis a work of breathtaking scope: meticulously researched, it engagingly dramatizes the known events of Ines Suarez's life, crafting them into a novel full of the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.",

         "Born into a poor family in Spain, Ines, a seamstress, finds herself condemned to a life of hard work without reward or hope for the future. It is the sixteenth century, the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when her shiftless husband disappears to the New World, Ines uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure. After her treacherous journey takes her to Peru, she learns that her husband has died in battle. Soon she begins a fiery love affair with a man who will change the course of her life: Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro.\nValdivia's dream is to succeed where other Spaniards have failed: to become the conquerer of Chile. The natives of Chile are fearsome warriors, and the land is rumored to be barren of gold, but this suits Valdivia, who seeks only honor and glory. Together the lovers Ines Suarez and Pedro de Valdivia will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage a bloody, ruthless war against the indigenous Chileans--the fierce local Indians led by the chief Michimalonko, and the even fiercer Mapuche from the south. The horrific struggle will change them forever, pulling each of them toward their separate destinies.\nInes of My Soulis a work of breathtaking scope: meticulously researched, it engagingly dramatizes the known events of Ines Suarez's life, crafting them into a novel full of the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.",

         "Beautifully written! Ines of my Soul is not just a story about how the nation of Chile was build. It is a captivating story about Ines Suarez, a strong and daring woman whose bravery and passion helped conquer love and with it, a beautiful land. Along with Ines, Allende introduces many characters that help mold this story. This story gives us a better understanding of the bravery the conquistadores had and helps us feel compassion for Native Indians, and the suffering they went through in trying to defend their land. Allende does a wonderful job in making each character rich and full of depth. Her descriptions are thorough and poetic. This book will play in your mind days after having read it.",

It is written in the voice of Ines Suarez, mistress to Pedro de Valdiva, conqueror of Chile, and later wife to Rodrigo de Quiroga, governor of Chile. I enjoyed the earlier character development sections of the book much more that the later chapters which reported repeated battles and massacres, most of which did not involve Ines as a participant.

         "I was really looking forward to reading this, but I have to admit it was a little disappointing. It is clear that Isabel Allende did a ton of research for this book, however, more often than not it comes across as a history lesson more than the story of someone's life told from their perspective. \n On top of that, there are huge meandering sections that feel superfluous and ruin the flow of the story being told. I think part of that is the format, making it more of journal entries to Isabel than an actual book. When you write journals, there are meandering sections, but if you are creating a journal then maybe it is best to leave them out because it is incredibly distracting. My eyes would just glaze over. \n That said, Ines is a very strong, likeable character. I enjoyed learning about her life as I had never really heard anything about her before. I hadn't even heard of her husband. The depiction of her relationship with the Inca was probably my favorite part, because she clearly respected them even if she didn't always like them or understand their beliefs. \n Actually, the general depiction of the Native American peoples in this book is pretty on point. I sympathized with them WAY more than I sympathized with the Spanish Conquistadors. And it is heartbreaking to read about their decimation and subjugation, which Ines has sympathy for. So, character complexity is definitely there- because Ines certainly feels that Christianity should be spread, but she also doesn't follow its dictates as well as she might be expected to. \n Fascinating stuff- worth reading if you can get past the wandering bits.",

         "Ines of My Soul is a fictionalized account of the courageous Spanish woman who helped found Chile and was the mistress of its founder, Pedro. Ines is a terrific protagonist - brave but compassionate, beautiful and sexy. She is telling the story as an old, dying woman, and the story goes back and forth with the present. \n The first half of the book is very well done, and tells the story of how Ines and Pedro came to Chile, their treacherous crossing of the Atacama Desert, and their early years in Chile. Unfortunately, I found that the second half of the book dragged quite a bit. The story becomes too much about Pedro and too little about Ines. (view spoiler)[The fact that the book closes with Pedro's death confirmed for me that Allende became too entranced with the love story of Ines and Pedro, instead of the story of Ines. (hide spoiler)] Instead of being a book about a brave woman, it became the story of Pedro and Ines's lost love. \n The sections in the present, as Ines is dying, become increasingly distracting and repetitive. I don't know if that's done on purpose, to underscore Ines's weakened state, but I didn't like it. It compares unfavorably to one of my favorite books, Memoirs of a Geisha, which is also supposed to be dictated by an old woman, but is written much more clearly and in much more beautiful prose. That was another problem I had with the book - I just didn't find the writing that revelatory. I know that may be an issue with the translation, but I found some of the prose awkward and clunky, not what I expected from an author of Allende's stature. \n I also found the type of narration problematic. Ines is too omniscient a narrator for her \"old woman memoir\" to be taken seriously. What the heck was that random inclusion of the POV of the Mapuche? I just didn't get it. Ines also at times come across as too progressive for her time. I'm totally willing to believe that she was a courageous woman who did many of the things portrayed, but her compassion for the Indians, especially the Mapuche who she believes slaughtered so many of her loved ones, doesn't track historically or even with the way the character is drawn. \n While the book provides a good education about the history of the founding of Chile, it does not make me want to pick up another Allende book any time soon.",

         "Born into a poor family in Spain, Ines, a seamstress, finds herself condemned to a life of hard work without reward or hope for the future. It is the sixteenth century, the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when her shiftless husband disappears to the New World, Ines uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure. After her treacherous journey takes her to Peru, she learns that her husband has died in battle. Soon she begins a fiery love affair with a man who will change the course of her life: Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro.\nValdivia's dream is to succeed where other Spaniards have failed: to become the conquerer of Chile. The natives of Chile are fearsome warriors, and the land is rumored to be barren of gold, but this suits Valdivia, who seeks only honor and glory. Together the lovers Ines Suarez and Pedro de Valdivia will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage a bloody, ruthless war against the indigenous Chileans--the fierce local Indians led by the chief Michimalonko, and the even fiercer Mapuche from the south. The horrific struggle will change them forever, pulling each of them toward their separate destinies.\nInes of My Soulis a work of breathtaking scope: meticulously researched, it engagingly dramatizes the known events of Ines Suarez's life, crafting them into a novel full of the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.",

         "A magnificent romantic/historical/adventure novel set in India at the time of mutiny. The Far Pavilions is a story of 19th Century India, when the thin patina of English rule held down dangerously turbulent undercurrents. It is a story about and English man - Ashton Pelham-Martyn - brought up as a Hindu and his passionate, but dangerous love for an Indian princess. It's a story of divided loyalties, of tender camaraderie, of greedy imperialism and of the clash between east and west. To the burning plains and snow-capped mountains of this great, humming continent, M.M. Kaye brings her quite exceptional gift of immediacy and meticulous historical accuracy, plus her insight into the human heart.",

         "The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. \"World War Z\" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.\nRanging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.\nMost of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"\nNote: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.

The original Dragonlance chronicles were the first 'big kid' books I ever read, the first ones I checked out from the YA section in the old Bel Air library. Every once in a great while, I go back to them. This newer series takes place during the empty spaces between books. A lot happens in those spaces and reading Dwarven Depths filled in the gap between books 1 and 2 in a comfortable way.

Solopsist Doctor, has only one l.\" \n [Dr.:] Polonski frowns and changes the angle of his notebook. \n This is the third Mitchell book I've read, and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. It departs from his usual style of multiple narrators and follows the main character, Eiji Miyake in his search for his father in Tokyo. Parts of the story are so moving, I had to stop for a moment to take it in - and other parts (truthfully, some of the same parts) were so funny I must have looked like I was having some sort of fit to the people around me. \n Mitchell tells the story of Eiji Miyake not only through direct plot writing, but also through Miyake's fantasies, memories and dreams. Though the technique is a little disorienting at first, it falls into a natural rhythm fairly quickly. \n \"#9 Dream\" is a song written and performed by John Lennon and featured on his album Walls and Bridges. The number 9 (and 333) not only figures heavily as a recurring theme throughout the book, but so do the Beatles. There is also a reference to Norwegian Wood (both the novel by Murakami and the Beatles song \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird has Flown.\")) \n In describing the hostesses at Aphrodite's Soapworld, the bouncer describes hostess number 9 as \"ah, number 9 is beyond the grasp of ordinary mortals.\" \n \"'The meaning of the ninth dream begins after all meanings appear to be dead and gone.'\" (attributed to John Lennon in Miyake's dream.) \n Within Number9Dream, Mitchell has woven in a series of children's stories and the journal of Miyake's great uncle, a kaiten pilot. So this has some of the same feel of his other books - but the two additional stories are far more contained. These two stories also don't seem to resonate with me as well as the (sub?)plots in either Cloud Atlas and Ghostwritten (particularly Ghostwritten.) \n There are Mitchell's usual references to Murakami (not just to Norwegian Wood above, but also the half-read book Miyake refers to having left in his locker about the man left down at the bottom of a dry well (Murakami's The Wind-up Bird Chronicles.) One of the characters in Ghostwritten, the Mongolian hit man Suhbataar, makes an appearance in this novel as well, working for the Yakuza. After meeting his destiny in PanOpticon, Miyake notes, \"The cloud atlas turns its pages over.\" All of Mitchell's novels (that I've read so far - only 3) seem to speak to each other in whispering asides. \n One of the joys of Mitchell's writing is the humour woven through even the most disturbing parts of the plot. References to movies are used liberally via the owner of the video rental shop Miyake works for. My particular favorite, regarding the movie, Paris, Texas: \n Buntaro to Miyake:\"This, kid, is an existential classic. Man with no memory meets woman with huge hooters.\" I think that summary was left out of the IMDB synopsis. \n As with Ghostwritten, Mitchell adds asides through his characters about how writing speaks to how create and re-create our world, our history, and ultimately - our future: \n \"You know, we are all of us writers busy writing our own fictions about how the world is, and how it came to be this way. We concoct plots and ascribe motives that may, or may not, coincide with the truth.\" \n He also uses the voice of Miyake's mother to have a dig at therapy, \"Be careful of counselors, therapists, head doctors. They poke around, and take things to bits without thinking about how they'll put it all back together.\" The struggle of Miyake's mother, and Miayke's reaction to her, slowly becomes one of the most compelling plots of the book, shifting the focus from the quest for the father to the reunion with the mother. \n Some of the most moving lines throughout the book slip by so fast wrapped in the context of the action, that you could almost miss them. After exacting revenge on the thunder god's statue, Miyake notes, \"I am not afraid. You have to value yourself to be afraid.\" \n I think I would put this between Ghostwritten (as my favorite) and Cloud Atlas in terms of enjoyment. Having a single narrating voice is a change and works well for the telling of this story. I catch myself wondering though, what would happen if Mitchell stepped away from referencing Murakami and found a truly independent voice for his stories. \n But I digress. \n At the end of the reading, I should really have had a Beatles song in my head, but I didn't. I had Colder Months from Alpha Rev. Go figure. \n these thoughts of pain \n don't make a sound \n keep us hidden \n in the lost and found \n these colder months \n wincing social graces \n we keep with us \n these fallen faces.",

Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses--through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck--a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father's identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.",

         "The High Window was a pretty entertaining novel. I didn't like the characters in The High Window as much as those in the only other Raymond Chandler book I've read, The Lady in the Lake, but the mystery in the former is definitely more complex than that in the latter. The only problem I have with it is how (view spoiler)[one character convinces another character that she (the second character) committed a murder when she didn't and she (the first character) actually did (hide spoiler)]. I wouldn't be surprised if something like that happened in real life but it's still kind of strange.",

To be seen was death. \"Don't!\" he wanted to scream. \"Don't look at me! Don't report me! Please!\" But the muscles that controlled his mouth were as frozen as the rest of him. The tiny part of his mind that wasn't flooded with panic knew that that was good -- now that he had a fake I.D., the last thing he should do was act like a boy who's had to hide. But to act normal, he needed to move, to obey the man at the front and sit down. And he couldn't make his body do that, either. -- from Among the ImpostorsLuke Garner is terrified. \nOut of hiding for the first time in his life, he knows that any minute one of his new classmates at Hendricks School for Boys could discover his secret: that he's a third child passing as the recently deceased Lee Grant. And in a society where it's illegal for families to have more than two children, being a third child means certain death at the hands of the dreaded Population Police. \nHis first experience outside the safety of his home is bewildering. There's not a single window anywhere in the school; Luke can't tell his classmates apart (even as they subject him to brutal hazing); and the teachers seem oblivious to it all. \nDesperate to fit in, Luke endures the confusion and teasing until he discovers an unlocked door to the outside, and a chance to understand what is really going on. But to take this chance -- to find out the secrets of Hendricks -- Luke will need to put aside his fears and discover a courage that a lifetime in hiding couldn't thwart. \nOnce again, best-selling author Margaret Peterson Haddix delights her fans with this spine-tingling account of an all-too-possible future. Among the Impostorsis a worthy companion to Among the Hiddenand a heart-stopping thriller in its own right.",

         "Not a lot of writers would be brave enough to pen a love story between a girl-turned-old-lady and a wizard missing a vital organ. \n But fantasy dowager Diana Wynne Jones was one of those brave enough to write such a story -- and not only does she succeed, but she creates a brilliantly charming story. It's crammed with complex magical conspiracies, unlikely heroines, dimension-hopping, curse and contracts, and some sly subversions of the usual fairy tale tropes (such as good things only happening to the youngest). \n A misunderstanding leads to ordinary Sophie Hatter being turned into a crone by the malevolent Witch of the Waste. Finding old age oddly liberating, she wanders away from her hat shop, and becomes the cleaning lady for the powerful wizard Howl, who lives in a moving castle with his fire demon Calcifer. Calcifer strikes a deal with Sophie -- if she can break the contract between him and Howl, he'll restore her youth. The catch is, neither he nor Howl can tell her WHAT the contract is. \n While assisting Howl and his apprentice Michael, Sophie discovers that Howl's reputation for wickedness is rather exaggerated -- he doesn't actually eat girls' hearts and suck out their souls, but he is a prodigious flirt who abandons girls once he gets them to fall for him. He's also kind of a drama queen. But soon Sophie finds that the powerful wizard is ensnared in a horrifying curse -- and Howl has only a little time before the curse strikes. \n One of Diana Wynne Jones' favorite sources of humor was poking fun at the tropes of fantasy and fairy tales. If you've ever read a fairy tale -- \"Cinderella,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- you'll know that the youngest kids are always the pure-hearted ones destined for great things. So Jones obviously had a lot of fun with this idea, and uses it as the jumping-off point for \"Howl's Moving Castle.\" \n Along the way, she peppers her novel with a complicated, intertwined conspiracy that Sophie only discovers as she spends more time with Howl, involving a curse (\"\"Go and catch a falling star/Get with child a mandrake root...\"), a lost prince, and the Witch of the Waste. The curse's slow unveiling creates a growing sense of dread without revealing much, except the awareness that something terrible is rising slowly. \n But it's handled in a fun, tongue-in-cheek way, with Sophie having to deal with Howl's immaturity (he has a green slime attack when his hair is dyed ginger) as well as the woes associated with magic (the seven-league boots). And Jones clearly had some fun throwing odd twists into the mix. \n Sophie is a rather timid, dull character until her unexpected aging sets her free from her unhappy life. Her sensible, assertive new self is a pretty entertaining heroine, especially as she starts feeling both exasperation and romantic interest in Howl. Howl is a delightful character -- he's fickle, immature, flamboyant, eccentric, irresponsible and has cultivated a distinct image as a wicked, heart-devouring sorcerer to keep everyone far away from him. And yet, he's oddly charming and fun to read about, especially as a foil to the sensible Sophie. \n Moving castles, fire demons and an oddly charming wizard make \"Howl's Moving Castle\" an absolute must-read -- especially for those who like their complicated fantasies to be a little tongue-in-cheek.",

Cath is scatterbrained, messy, and-since she had her heart broken a few years back-emotionally closed off. Si is impossibly tidy, bitchy, and desperate for a man of his own. They live in London's West Hampstead along with their lifelong friends, Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with a devil-spawn child and a terrifying Swedish nanny, Ingrid.\nAll's well (sort of) until the sudden arrival of a college friend-the stunningly beautiful Portia, who's known for breaking hearts. Though they've grown up and grown apart from Portia, the four friends welcome her back into the fold. But does Portia have a hidden agenda or is she merely looking to reconnect with old friends? Her reappearance soon unleashes a rollicking series of events that tests the foursome's friendships to the limit and leaves them wondering if a happy ending is in store.\nFortunately, Cath has plenty to take her mind off Portia's schemes-like her gutsy decision to leave her job in advertising to fulfill her dream of opening a bookstore. And then there's James, the sexy real-estate agent who keeps dropping by even after the bookstore deal is done. With his irresistible smile and boyish charm could he be the one to melt Cath's heart?\nTold with Jane Green's captivating wit and flare, Bookendsis above all a story about friendship-its twists, turns and complications-and how it weathers the challenges of love, ambition, marriage, and, most of all, growing up.

         "I absolutely loved the first book of this trilogy, Shaman's Crossing, but Forest Mage was a disappointment. The plot of the book is this: \"the magic\" (which seems to be a sentient being of such power that it's not clear why it requires human help) shoves the protagonist, Nevare, across the country of Gernia until he reaches the Speck forest. It does this by screwing up his life until he has no other options. What really bothered me about this plotline (aside from the fact that, in the context of the trilogy, it's little more than a \"bridge book\" getting us from Point A to Point C) is that Nevare has no free will. Whenever he tries to assert himself, his situation gets worse. And nothing that goes wrong (even his own sudden obesity) is his fault. It's gone from very easy to relate to his problems in book one, to almost impossible here. If I'd realized after finishing Shaman's Crossing that the rest of the trilogy would be an exercise in determinism, I'm not sure I would have continued at all. \n There are some positives in this book: both the world and the characters who inhabit it remain three-dimensional and fascinating, and Hobb's writing style is still good. It is overlong, though; I can't imagine why the publishers thought it was necessary for this installment to be 150 pages LONGER than the first book, and the excessive length plus numerous grammatical, continuity and other minor errors made me think it was a rush job. And it's hard to spend this much time reading about a protagonist who spends most of his time on his own. Supporting characters tend to appear for chunks of the book, then disappear again; there isn't a single one who is present throughout, although many of them are far more interesting than Nevare at this point. \n Hate to say it, but I would recommending stopping after book one.",

         "The Barnes Noble Review\nDark mysticism and primordial natural magic clash with the ever-expanding boundaries of the \"civilized\" world in the second volume of Robin Hobb's Soldier Son trilogy, Forest Mage.\nThe sequel to 2005's Shaman's Crossingfinds protagonist Nevare Burvelle -- the second son of a nobleman and destined for a career in the military -- with his world turned upside down. After surviving a plague that wiped out many of the students and instructors at the king's military academy, Nevare returns home for his brother's wedding, only to learn that he has been medically discharged from the school. The plague usually leaves its survivors skeletally thin, but Nevare, inexplicably, has begun to gain massive amounts of weight. With his family believing he's a glutton, Nevare is disowned by his father and eventually ends up finding work as a lowly cemetery guard in a frontier town near the border with the Specks, a race of dapple-skinned forest dwellers who possess powerful natural magic. But in a world where technology never stops advancing, can the Specks survive? And what does the suddenly bloated Nevare have to do with their struggle?\nSet in a sprawling, vividly described realm that is as majestic as it is menacing, and powered by some extremely topical themes (environmentalism, cultural homogenization, human rights, religious persecution, etc.), the Soldier Son trilogy is easily Hobb's most significant work to date. Incorporating elements of military fantasy, New Age spirituality, and political allegory, Forest Magecan be faulted only for suffering from a serious case of middle-volume syndrome: As the second installment of a trilogy, it lacks both a true beginning and a satisfactory ending. All will be forgotten, however, when the concluding volume (tentatively entitled Renegade Magic) of this unique and powerfully moving saga is released in 2007. Paul Goat Allen",

The Plenimarans, at war with Skalans, have decided to defeat their ancient enemy by raising up the Dead God, Seriamaius. The early attempts at this reincarnation--masterminded by the sinister Duke Mardus and his sorcerous minion Vargul Ashnazai--once left Seregil in a sorcerous coma. Now, an ancient prophecy points to his continuing role in the quest to stop Mardus in his dread purpose.\nSeregil's friend and Mentor, the wizard Nysander, has long been the guardian of a deadly secret. In a secret, silver-lined room hidden well beneath the Oreska, he has served for most of his 300 years as the keeper of a nondescript clay cup. But this cup, combined with a crystal crown and some wooden disks, forms the Helm of Seriamaius, and any mortal donning the reconstructed Helm will become the incarnation of the god on earth.\nNysander holds the cup and Mardus the wooden disks--one of which was responsible for Seregil's coma--but the crown must still be located. Threatened under pain of death by Nysander to keep his quest a secret even from his loyal companion, Alec, Seregil is dispatched to find the last missing piece of the Helm so that he and Nysander can destroy it. But this is only the beginning of one of his deadliest journeys ever, for the prophecy also holds that four will come together in a time of darkness, and gradually all that Seregil values is placed at risk as he, Alec, Nysander and Micum are drawn into a deadly web of terror and intrigue.",

         "I absolutely loved this book. Susan Elizabeth Phillips always knows how to create interesting yet relatable characters! Kenny Traveler and Emma Wells-Finch are to die for. Their relationship starts off because Kenny, a pro golf player, had some negative events he \"caused\" plastered in the media. So, naturally the he gets suspended from playing. With all of his free time he gets the task of driving Lady Emma, a headmistress from England, around Texas. Lady Emma comes to Texas in mind with loosing her reputation as a sensible woman. Problem is, she's trying to cause trouble and Kenny is trying to stay away from it! \n Not only did I love this book because of the setting (a small town in Texas) but because the relationship between the two characters was easy going, natural, and very very cute :) \n She curled her mouth into what she hoped was a seductive smile and tried to speak without moving her lips. \"Kiss me at once.\" \n \"No,\" he said indignantly. \n \"Why not?\" \n \"Because I don't like your attitude.\" \n She had been a bit bossy, but that was only because she was nervous. \"I apologize.\" \n His eyes settled on her mouth. \"Okay, I'll kiss you.\" \n The focus of this being that SEP conjured up amazing characters. Kenny was the perfect hero, caring, confident, and laid back. Emma was sensible, sweet and passionate. They both had the right amount of flaw and good in them. Both were as likable as the other and neither of them were too dramatic. SEP's writing never gets old. Her ways of describing what the characters felt and thought were beyond my expectations! \n \"For a moment he could have sworn he smelled violets, which was very peculiar, since he had no idea what violets smelled like, except somehow he knew they smelled just like Lady Emma.\" \n She also threw in a little side story. To say the least, Tori and Dexter were my favorite side story of all time. Sometimes I found myself starting to read the next chapter wanting to read more about how their relationship progressed. Anyway, definitely a must read and an all time favorite!",

It's an episodic adventure, mostly small in scope - there are fights with bandits, an evil enchanter, and smalltime nobility of dubious morals, but no great evil threatens the land. The focus is on Taran's struggle to find an identity as an adult, beginning with his search for his parents. \n This always resonated particularly well with me. I'm adopted, and while I have a loving and supportive family and no real desire to dig up the past, I well remember that faint desire to be special. Maybe I'm a princess! Maybe I'm the heir to some vast fortune! Maybe if I figure out who my birth parents are, life will hand me something lovely on a platter. That's what Taran sets out looking for, and of course it's not at all what he finds - which was very much the message I needed to hear as a kid. \n Rather than some longed-for validation, Taran finds hard work, heartbreak, and friendship, all gotten the marginally less old-fashioned way than being born to it. The morals of the various stories aren't exactly subtle, and some work better than others - I never really got the Morda interlude - they follow a reasonable progression, and some of them are just delightful. Llonio son of Llonwen is probably the best, but I am a total sucker for crafting as well. And the final realization, that Taran is exactly who he is and no more, regardless of his still-unknown parentage, works just as well for me now as it did then. \n I might still be a princess, though.

         "Well I want to say that this entire collection is unparalleled, exceptional, dynamic, powerful, compelling, overwhelming, engrossing, absorbing, expressive, poignant, sorrowful, efficacious in every aspect, I could go on and on... \n But instead, I am going to focus on my favorite short story in this work, in fact, my favorite short story of all time. \"A Wall of Fire Rising\" is by far the most powerful, painful piece of literature I have ever had the opportunity of reading. Not only do I relate to this work on a personal level, but I also admire the technical genius of Edwidge Danticat. \n So let's get started. Pull out your Prozac people. This story is a gripping tragedy that is so entirely personal, and human that reading it inflicts emotional pain that is so powerful it is almost suffocating. If you thought you were emotionally unstable, you just don't know, my friend. If you need a happy ending to feel satisfied with a work, this story is not for you. There is suffering, struggling, (view spoiler)[suicide (hide spoiler)], and anguish. It will cause you to feel anxiety that borders on agony. \n Our narrator is a man, Guy, fated to repeat the same miserable existence of those before him (his father). Feeling disconsolate and hopeless, he develops a deeply disconcerting fascination with a hot air balloon that is virtually intangible. His life is nothing but discontent, suffering, and poverty. He is drowning, always being held down by the limits of his socioeconomic status, forever leading a destitute life. He has a wife, Lili, and a son that live in equally desperate conditions. His son happens to be reading speeches that resemble Guy's life a little too much... \n The balloon (and also the moon as he describes it) represents freedom and thus a happier life (or lack of life, since living and freedom are not compatible) for him. The speeches that the son is learning are related to the title of the story. They are about the Haitian revolution in which slaves were burned to death on plantations. The fire in the story is also the fire that floats the balloon - a duality that illustrates the power of fire, for freedom and/or destruction. The speech has its own fire -the passion and conviction that is just as abundant. Perhaps in some ways the killing of the slaves was in a way, freeing them.(view spoiler)[ This may be a parallel to how he uses the hot air balloon to kill himself - becoming free just as the slaves had. He wasn't able to live freely, constrained by the barriers of his socioeconomic state, which lead to his death. (hide spoiler)] He is virtually a slave to his society, cleaning latrines and struggling to feed his family. He is overwhelmed and hopeless with life, especially since his father endured the same strife. \n Guy's decision in the end was heartbreaking, but the scene itself was the real knife in the chest. (view spoiler)[ Not only does he kill himself, but our sick and demented author had to have his son and wife bear witness. This scene, although devastating, contributed to the symbolism and imagery of the piece, adding even more depth to an already intensely evocative work. (hide spoiler)] \n So, despite the fact that I am a masochist for continuing to read and recommend this work to others, I cannot help myself. Somehow this unbearable, painful piece has wormed its way into my heart eternally, and for that reason, this grossly underrated book, deserves all of the recognition and praise I can give. Thank you Danticat, for your ability to create a work so moving that it has completely unraveled me, penetrating and manifesting itself in a part of me that I will never be able to extract it from.",

Krak!Danticat establishes herself as the latest heir to that narrative tradition with nine stories that encompass both the cruelties and the high ideals of Haitian life. They tell of women who continue loving behind prison walls and in the face of unfathomable loss; of a people who resist the brutality of their rulers through the powers of imagination.

         "Book #73 of 2009 \n While I was reading this book, I felt it didn't really click with me too well. It was pretty cute, and parts of it were hilarious, especially the hen/stag party bit, but I just wasn't feeling the overarching story theme. It might have been because of the sort of ridiculously fast move from swooning over an accent to living together, or it might have been because as a reader you just don't get a whole lot about Iain, since the story is in first person. It also might have been because of Iain's age - 47. Which meant that he's would be a good 21 years older than I am and he's a sheep farmer and... I just felt like I didn't connect. I think I like my romances with more external conflict. \n But he was a good man, a solid man, in the story. And since I finished this book just before a long run, I had 10 long miles to contemplate the story. And the more I mulled it over, the more I realized that I did like Iain because he was a good man. He may not be a \"typical\" romantic hero, but I think he's more REAL. So in the end, I'm left with some warm fuzzies from this story. Not clamoring for more, not my favorite romance to date, but it was a pretty decent read.",

Clad in a deliciously woolly sweater, the burly Scotsman seems to be holding up a wall at the cocktail party. So Kathie makes her move...and winds up stark naked with him in bed, where his thick Scottish brogue, thick manly chest, and thick... other parts...drive her to do things she's never done before. Like fall in love.\nAnd if things aren't moving fast enough--and on the wrong side of the road, no less--Kathie is about to visit Iain's sheep farm in the Scottish Highlands and meet his sons. She's feeling a wee bit nervous. Because she can't tell where this mad affair is going--except north...",

It is a captivating story about Ines Suarez, a strong and daring woman whose bravery and passion helped conquer love and with it, a beautiful land. Along with Ines, Allende introduces many characters that help mold this story. This story gives us a better understanding of the bravery the conquistadores had and helps us feel compassion for Native Indians, and the suffering they went through in trying to defend their land. Allende does a wonderful job in making each character rich and full of depth. Her descriptions are thorough and poetic. This book will play in your mind days after having read it.",
